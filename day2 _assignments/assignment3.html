	<p>You may write me down in history<br>

	With your bitter, twisted lies,<br>

	You may trod me in the very dirt<br>

	But still, like dust, I'll rise.<br>

	Does my sassiness upset you?<br>

	Why are you beset with gloom?<br>

	'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br>

	Pumping in my living room.</p>
