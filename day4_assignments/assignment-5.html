	<p>College is the most beautiful thing that you can experience in your whole life. Make sure to fully enjoy it along with studies. For me the most beautiful thing that happened in the college is the fest. I have attended all the college fest till date and it was really amazing. The fun that we have there is truly amazing.</p>
